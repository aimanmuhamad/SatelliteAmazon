Analyzing Amazon forest from label satellite image chips with atmospheric conditions and various classes of land cover/land use. Resulting algorithms will help the global community better understand where, how, and why deforestation happens all over the world - and ultimately how to respond.  

This problem was tackled with Deep Learning models (using TensorFlow and Keras).
